# SimPDF

Simplify gofpdf.Fpdf document generation with with this wrapper for use in golang.

## Simplify and Expand

SimPDF has a simple goal of simplifing the [gofpdf.Fpdf](https://github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf/) package for use in golang
for the masses. The gofpdf package is a great PDF creator and has many various options that are hard to utilize for novice
programmers. This hopes to be solved, _slightly_, by this package.

Image handling, and Table creation are 2 examples of simplifing the original package for ease of use. Their are more features
in this package to make life easier from making a simple automated report or something even more difficult.
